## Description of the project 

Despite all the evidences presented by G.Urbanet al.  (1) (2017), we decided to repeat empirical experiences in order to check if their conclusions are relevant for a more complex data set.  To do so we choose to firstly reproduce the main experiments performed by G.Urbanet al. and secondly to adjust our network in order to match the minimal requirement in order to be performing on CIFAR-100.
